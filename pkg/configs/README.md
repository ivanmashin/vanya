Configs package defines an embedding for your config structs that simplifies config initialization and exploring in
multiple formats. It uses [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) under the hood.

This package is heavily used by [vanya](https://github.com/ivanmashin/vanya) to generate elegant configs for you
application.  
It also Includes some predefined config structs for common use cases (see [predefined.go](./predefined.go))
